# Weather-Forecasting
Purpose of this project is to predict the temperature using different algorithms like linear regression, random forest regression, and Decision tree regression. The output value should be numerically based on multiple extra factors like maximum temperature, minimum temperature, cloud cover, humidity, and sun hours in a day, precipitation, pressure and wind speed.
## Aim:-
To provide the datsset with recommendations based on the personalized Weather-Forecasting content.

## Tools & Technology used:

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Streamlit
- Heroku
- Tableau
- Python libraries: pandas, seaborn, plotly and matplotlib


## System Requirement

- pandas==1.3.4
- plotly==5.6.0
- streamlit==1.5.1
